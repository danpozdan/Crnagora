The "Maps" folder is needed to analyse which industries are developed better
    and where exactly are they. We parse data on reviews on Google Maps and
    analyse it, by making maps, tables, etc.


Files:
    Output_files:
        Stars.xlsx (Excel file) : An Excel file with data on ratings by field and
            city.
        Analysed_stats.xlsx (Excel file) : An Excel file with analysis of the
            Stars.xlsx file.

    Source_links.txt (txt file) : a text file with the links to maps that we
        want to parse. More precisely, each line is structured in the following
        way: name|link

    Get_stars.py (Python code -> Output_files/Stars.xlsx) : The code goes through
        all the links in Source_links.txt and parses the data needed (stars and
        number of reviews). The only problem with it that it doesn't know how to
        scroll down the website, thus we did it manually, which took no more than
        5 minutes in total.

    Analyse_data.py (Python code -> Output_files/Analysed_stats.xlsx) : Analyse
        the data from Output_files/Stars.xlsx. Draw charts and maps.

    INFO.txt (txt file) : the info file you are reading now.

Steps:
    1. Launch the Get_stars.py file. The output will be Output_files/Stars.xlsx.
    2. Launch the Analyse_data.py. The output will be Output_files/
        Analysed_stats.xlsx. Also, maps will appear.
    3. If you want to see charts, remove the "#" in the end of the Analyse_data.py
        code and repeat step 2.
