The "Real_estate" folder is needed to calculate the cost of real estate. We parsed
    data on the cost of non-residential property in Montenegro and analysed it.
    We calculated the price per square meter, made a function that finds the average
    price for meter, given the approximate footage. Then, some inferences about the
    cost were made.


Files:
    Data:
        Realitica.xlsx (Excel file) : An Excel file with the prices, footage, and
            city names for all non-residential property in 4 cities.

    Realitica.py (Python code -> Data/Realitica.xlsx) : The code makes the
        Data/Realitica.xlsx file and draws some charts. In addition, the
        aforementioned function is here.
